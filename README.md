# Sampling Distribution and Standard Error


## Overview

This project explores foundational statistical concepts such as population and sample, sampling distribution, and standard error using a dataset of university students. It demonstrates how to derive insights from data when accessing the entire population is impractical.

The project aims to:

- Obtain samples from a population and calculate statistics.

- Understand the variation between population parameters and sample statistics.

- Visualize sampling distributions and compute standard errors to estimate reliability.
## Key Features

- Population parameter calculations: mean, variance, and standard deviation.

- Sampling techniques: extracting subsets of data and computing sample statistics.

- Demonstrations of sampling distributions and their characteristics.

- Standard error computation and its significance in statistics.
## Technology Used

- Python: For data manipulation and statistical calculations.

- Jupyter Notebook: To create an interactive and explanatory environment.

- Libraries: Pandas: 
For data manipulation. 

NumPy: For numerical computations.

Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
